A freestyle train station. It introduces some new special tracks, which will serve as platforms for cargo or passengers.

[h1]Instructions[/h1]
Lay platforms alongside normal tracks, then place a platform marker and a track marker where you want the platform and the track to end. Repeat at the other end.
WAIT A MOMENT and let the computer think.
Now you have built a terminal, trains will stop between your track markers.
Add more platforms, tracks and markers, a popup will ask you if you want to join your new terminal to the other ones. You can have up to ]] .. tostring(_constants.maxNTerminals) .. [[ terminals in one station.

Now click your station to open the configuration menu and add some connections.
- Adjacent platforms are connected together automatically. If they are too far apart, connect them with exits, stairs or underpasses. You can also connect two bridge exits with a suitable path - or a stairs or lift asset.
- Every set of adjacent ground platforms requires street access, an underpass, a lift or stairs.
- Every set of adjacent bridge platforms requires a lift or an underpass.
- Every bridge level requires a lift, or an underpass close to lifts or stairs on a ground platform.
- Every set of adjacent underground platforms requires stairs.
- Every underground level requires an underground entrance, or a ground platform with an underpass, or a higher underground level with stairs down - if you have multiple underground levels, you can add stairs on the higher levels, to go down to the lower levels.

You can share a platform between two terminals, for example the first 100 metres with terminal 1 and the rest with terminal 2. If you do that, the heads will connect automatically if they are 7 metres apart or less. If they are farther, use end exits and connect them with a suitable path (street menu).
You cannot share one stretch of platform or track among multiple terminals.

When you bulldoze a terminal, the mod will try to rebuild the tracks as they were before, to make changes easy: bulldoze a terminal, change what you need, then rebuild it with the markers. If you have bulldozed a terminal by mistake, keep the construction menu open and place a "restore" module on it to make it reappear.
When you bulldoze the station, everything will be bulldozed.

Lifts, stairs and underground entrances are in the assets, search for "freestyle station".

[h1]Tips:[/h1]
- Platforms are tracks and they can also suffer from micro splits and unevennesses, very difficult to see.
- To visualise the lanes and the splits, start the game in debug mode and press <AltGr> + <L>. This is particularly useful with multi-level underground stations. Try to lay platforms and tracks smoothly and cleanly.
- To work underground, use <NumPad 4> or the "Look Underground" track construction.
- Platforms only carry passengers or cargo if they are part of a terminal.
- 2.5 m platforms do not agree with bridges and tunnels. My bridges help, tunnels can't be helped.
- This mod adds bridges to help with elevated stations.
- Very thin paths help with certain setups: those are in my Street Fine Tuning mod.
- This mod adds pedestrian paths and bridges; some turn into bridges after placing them. For precision work, use the Street Fine Tuning "chunks" and "splitter" constructions.
- You can use pedestrian paths and bridges to link your station to the outside world. Their connections may appear broken when the construction menu is open, but repair themselves after you closed it.
- When you remove a terminal, the station will fully update after the construction menu is closed.
- Sound effects for stations are in my dedicated mod.
- Sound effects for trains are in my dedicated mod.
- Extra ground textures are in my terrain tweaks mod.
- If you want different buildings, use assets. There are mods with those.
- This mod adds stairs and lifts as configurable assets; they are useful for island platforms but can be used anywhere. My "Construction Mover" mod helps to place them easily. Still, the game does not handle them gracefully and <AltGr> + <L> will help you check if they snap to your network. Cycling between snappy and non-snappy roads or bridges in the parameter window might help.
- Use the track construction or the waypoint "Track Splitter" to do precision work.
- Use the track construction "Track Segment Remover" to easily remove underground tracks. It is in my Street Fine Tuning mod.
- Upgrading tracks does all tracks at once.
- If you have too many track types, use the categories in the menu to make life easier.
- Use \"Build with Collision\" sparingly around these stations.
- Some updates can make your existing stations look glitchy. If you see glitches, click your station to bring up the configuration menu, then add and remove something, like a roof. The glitch should go away.

[h1]Breaking changes:[/h1]
- Underground stations are now in the assets.
- Minor version 1.81 (31st August 2022) introduced important layout changes. Previously built terminals will keep working but might have some glitches. To benefit from the changes, remove them, wait for them to reappear and build them anew.
- Platforms do not connect automatically to adjacent roads, you must add an exit or a station.
- Minor version 1.99 (13th February 2023) makes existing walls invisible until you build a new one.
- Walls around tracks are only available on terminals built with version 1.99 or newer.
- Minor version 1.115 removed links from flush exits at the end of platforms, to avoid crashes. It also replaced older lifts and twin stairs (assets) with new ones.
- Minor Version 1.141 introduces head stations. Older platforms have no head option unless you destroy and rebuild them.
- Minor Version 1.156 introduces thick walls and dams. Existing station walls or fences might suddenly receive a thick wall and cause trouble. Use the new module "Remove Terminal Deco" on ALL terminals and then rebuild your deco.

[h1]Known issues:[/h1]
- Module placement is rather free, the player is allowed to do some unrealistic things. Proper checks would be too expensive.
- Station naming does not work properly.
- 2.5 m platforms do not agree with bridges and tunnels. Ask UG to make trackDistance work.
- Underpasses do not show underground and 0 m platforms cannot be fully repainted. Ask UG to fix the terrain when snapping tracks alongside.
- The bigger your station is, the longer it takes to add or remove a terminal. It can take over a minute, just wait.
- Some modules can only be placed after some others, eg stairs exits after stairs, but the configuration menu does not refresh automatically. After placing the first set of stairs, you need to close and reopen the menu for stairs exits to appear.
- Some track and signal mods are incompatible. As a general rule, avoid mods that overwrite or disable stock game tracks. Chances are you won't miss them anyway.
- After a while or after terraforming, the objects surrounding your station might throw collision errors whenever you try to configure the station. This is an old game problem and it happens with other stations, too. To get past it, start removing pedestrian bridges that snap into the station and add them back once you are done. If this does not help, do the same with adjoining tracks. If you still have no luck, patiently look for the guilty street, building or asset and remove it, then add it back once you are done.

Ein Freestyle-Bahnhof. Er führt einige neue Spezialgleise ein, die als Bahnsteige für Fracht oder Passagiere dienen werden.

[h1]Anleitung[/h1]
Lege Bahnsteigen entlang normaler Gleise und platziere dann eine Bahnsteig- und einen Gleismarker dort, wo die Bahnsteig und das Gleis enden sollen. Wiederhole den Vorgang am anderen Ende.
WARTE einen Moment und lass den Computer nachdenken.
Jetzt hast du einen Bahnhof gebaut, und die Züge werden zwischen den Gleismarker halten.
Füge weitere Bahnsteige, Gleise und Markierungen hinzu. Ein Popup-Fenster wird dich fragen, ob du deinen neuen Terminal mit den anderen verbinden möchtest. Du kannst bis zu ]] .. tostring(_constants.maxNTerminals) .. [[ Terminals in einem Bahnhof haben.

Klicke nun auf deinem Bahnhof, um das Konfigurationsmenü zu öffnen und einige Verbindungen hinzuzufügen.
- Benachbarte Bahnsteige werden automatisch miteinander verbunden. Wenn sie zu weit voneinander entfernt sind, verbinde sie mit Ausgängen, Treppen oder Unterführungen. Du kannst auch zwei Brückenausgänge mit einem geeigneten Weg verbinden - oder eine Treppe oder eine Aufzugsanlage.
- Jeder Satz benachbarter Bahnsteige am Boden erfordert einen Straßenzugang, eine Unterführung, einen Aufzug oder eine Treppe.
- Jede Reihe von benachbarten erhöhten Bahnsteigen erfordert einen Aufzug oder eine Unterführung.
- Jede Brückenebene erfordert einen Aufzug oder eine Unterführung in der Nähe eines ebenerdigen Aufzugs oder einer Treppe.
- Jede Gruppe von benachbarten unterirdischen Bahnsteigen erfordert eine Treppe.
- Jede unterirdische Ebene erfordert einen unterirdischen Eingang oder einen Bahnsteig am Boden mit einer Unterführung oder eine höhere unterirdische Ebene mit einer Treppe nach unten (wenn du mehrere unterirdische Ebenen hast, kannst du auf den höheren Ebenen eine Treppe hinzufügen, um zu den unteren Ebenen hinunter zu gelangen).

Du kannst einen Bahnsteig zwischen zwei Terminals teilen, zum Beispiel die ersten 100 Meter mit Terminal 1 und den Rest mit Terminal 2. Wenn du dies tust, verbinden sich die Köpfe automatisch, wenn sie höchstens 7 Meter voneinander entfernt sind. Sind sie weiter voneinander entfernt, verwende Endausgänge und verbinde sie mit einem geeigneten Weg (Straßenmenü).
Du kannst einen Bahnsteig- oder Gleisabschnitt nicht mit mehreren Terminals teilen.

Wenn du einen Terminal mit einem Bulldozer abreißt, versucht der Mod, die Gleise so wiederherzustellen, wie sie vorher waren, um Änderungen zu vereinfachen: Reiße einen Terminal mit einem Bulldozer auf, änder das, was du brauchst, und baue ihn dann mit den Markern wieder auf. Wenn du einen Terminal aus Versehen abgerissen hast, lasse das Konfigurationsmenü offen und füge ein "Zurücksetzen" Modul hinzu, damit er zurückkommt.
Wenn du den Bahnhof mit dem Bulldozer zerstörst, wird alles mit dem Bulldozer abgerissen.

Aufzüge, Treppen und unterirdische Eingänge findest du in den Assets, suche nach "freestyle station".

[h1]Hinweise:[/h1]
- Bahnsteigen sind Gleise und können auch unter Mikrospalten und Unebenheiten leiden, die sehr schwer zu sehen sind.
- Um die Fahrspuren und die Spaltungen zu visualisieren, starte das Spiel im Debug-Modus und drücke <AltGr> + <L>. Dies ist besonders bei mehrstöckigen U-Bahn-Stationen nützlich. Versuche, Gleise und Bahnsteige sauber zu verlegen.
- Um unterirdisch zu arbeiten, verwende <NumPad 4> oder die Gleiskonstruktion "Unterirdisch suchen".
- Bahnsteige befördern nur dann Passagiere oder Fracht, wenn sie Teil eines Terminals sind.
- 2,5 m hohe Bahnsteige vertragen sich nicht mit Brücken und Tunneln. Meine Brücken helfen, bei Tunneln kann man nichts machen.
- Dieser Mod fügt Brücken hinzu, um bei erhöhten Bahnhöfen zu helfen.
- Sehr dünne Pfade helfen bei bestimmten Setups: diese sind in meinem "Street Fine Tuning" Mod.
- Dieser Mod fügt Fußgängerwege und Brücken hinzu; einige verwandeln sich in Brücken, nachdem sie platziert wurden. Für Präzisionsarbeit, verwende die "Street Fine Tuning" "Chunks" und "Splits" Konstruktionen.
- Du kannst mit Fußgängerwegen und Brücken deinen Bahnhof mit der Außenwelt verbinden. Diese Verbindungen können zunächst als kaputt erscheinen, wenn das Konfigurationsmenü offen ist; sie reparieren sich aber von selbst, wenn das Menu sich schliesst.
- Wenn du ein Terminal entfernst, wird der Bahnhof erst nach Schliessen des Konfigurationsmenüs völlig aktualisiert.
- Soundeffekte für Bahnhöfe sind in meinem speziellen Mod enthalten.
- Soundeffekte für Züge sind in meinem speziellen Mod enthalten.
- Zusätzliche Bodentexturen befinden sich in meinem "Terrain Tweaks"-Mod.
- Wenn du andere Gebäude willst, benutze Assets. Es gibt Mods mit diesen.
- Diese Mod fügt Treppen und Aufzüge als konfigurierbare Objekte hinzu; sie sind nützlich für Insel-Bahnsteige, sie können aber überall verwendet werden. Meine "Construction Mover" Mod hilft, sie leicht zu platzieren. Dennoch, das Spiel behandelt sie nicht anmutig und <AltGr> + <L> wird Ihnen helfen, zu überprüfen, ob sie in Ihrem Netzwerk einrasten. Das Wechseln zwischen einrastenden und nicht einrastenden Straßen oder Brücken im Parameterfenster könnte helfen.
- Verwende den Gleisbau- oder Wegepunkt-"Gleisteiler", um Präzisionsarbeit zu leisten.
- Beim Aufrüsten von Gleisen werden alle Gleise auf einmal ausgebaut.
- Wenn du zu viele Streckentypen hast, nutze die Kategorien im Menü, um sich das Leben leichter zu machen.
- Verwende \"Build with Collision\" so wenig wie möglich um diesen Bahnhöfen.
- Einige Updates können dazu führen, dass deine vorhandenen Bahnhöfe komisch aussehen. Wenn dies vorkommt, klicke auf deinen Bahnhof, um das Konfigurationsmenü aufzurufen, füge dann irgendwas hinzu (z. B. ein Dach) und entferne es wieder. Der Fehler sollte dann verschwinden.

[h1]Inkompatible Änderungen:[/h1]
- U-Bahnhöfe sind jetzt in den Assets enthalten.
- Mit der Minor-Version 1.81 (31. August 2022) wurden wichtige Änderungen am Layout vorgenommen. Zuvor gebaute Terminals werden weiterhin funktionieren, können aber einige Fehler aufweisen. Um von den Änderungen zu profitieren, entferne sie, warte, bis sie wieder auftauchen, und baue sie neu.
- Bahnsteige verbinden sich nicht mehr automatisch mit angrenzenden Straßen, du musst eine Ausfahrt oder einen Bahnhof hinzufügen.
- Minor Version 1.99 (13. Februar 2023) macht bestehende Wände unsichtbar, bis du eine neue baust.
- Mauern um Gleise sind nur auf Terminals verfügbar, die mit Version 1.99 oder neuer gebaut wurden.
- Mit der Minor-Version 1.115 werden bündige Ausgänge an den Bahnsteigenden nicht mehr verbunden, um Abstürze zu vermeiden. Ältere Aufzug- und Zwillingstreppen-Assets wurden auch ersetzt.
- Mit der Minor-Version 1.141 werden Kopfbahnhöfe hinzugefügt. Ältere Terminals bekommen keine Kopf-Option, wenn du sie nicht abreisst und neu baust.
- Mit der Minor-Version 1.156 werden dicke Mauer hinzugefügt. Bestehende Bahnhofsmauer oder -Zäune bekommen möglicherweise eine dicke Wand und verursachen weitere Probleme. Verwende das neue Modul "Entferne Bahnsteig Deko" auf ALLEN Bahnsteigen und baue deine Deko dann wieder.

[h1]Bekannte Probleme:[/h1]
- Die Platzierung der Module ist ziemlich frei, der Spieler darf einige unrealistische Dinge tun. Richtige Kontrollen wären zu teuer.
- Die Benennung von Bahnhöfen funktioniert nicht richtig.
- 2,5 m Bahnsteige passen nicht mit Brücken und Tunneln überein. Bitte UG, trackDistance zum Laufen zu bringen.
- Unterführungen werden nicht bis ganz unten dargestellt und 0 m Bahnsteigen können nicht gut übermalt werden. Frage UG, damit sie den Boden beim Gleisen zusammenlegen reparieren.
- Je größer ein Bahnhof ist, desto länger dauert es, ein Terminal hinzuzufügen oder zu entfernen. Es kann über eine Minute dauern. Warte einfach ab.
- Einige Module können nur nach anderen platziert werden, z.B. Treppenausgänge nach Treppen, aber das Konfigurationsmenü wird nicht automatisch aktualisiert. Nachdem du die erste Treppe platziert hast, müsst du das Menü schließen und erneut öffnen, damit die Treppenausgänge erscheinen.
- Einige Gleis- und Signalmods sind nicht kompatibel. Generell gilt: Vermeide Mods, die die Originalgleise des Spiels überschreiben oder deaktivieren. Du wirst sie nicht vermissen.
- Nach einer Weile wird sich das Gebiet um Ihren Bahnhof herum entwickelt haben und möglicherweise Kollisionsfehler verursachen, wenn du versuchst, den Bahnhof zu konfigurieren. Dieses alte Problem betrifft auch andere Bahnhöfe. Suche geduldig erst nach der schuldigen Straße, dann nach dem Gleis, dann nach dem Gebäude oder der Anlage und entferne sie.
